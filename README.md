Hierarchical Brain and Physiological Responses to Hypoglycemia and HAAF in T1DM R01DK101440.  Our goal is to use advanced neuroimaging methods to determine how the brain responds to low blood sugars in patients with Type 1 diabetes. Findings from these studies will establish a framework for potential therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat this condition and may lead to the development of neuroimaging biomarkers that could be used to predict outcomes in interventional studies.
